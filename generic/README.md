# Micro17 - Generic

Generic variant of Micro17 for any radio.
This is still a simple copy of the ICOM version of this board. Just don't place the connector and solder to the test pads. 

## Flashing OpenRTX
WIP - ST-Link needed

## Installing Micro17 inside the radio
All up to you! Kynar modwires will be your best friend here.

## Configuring Micro17
As this module is embedded inside the radio, you'll have to either statically set your callsign inside the radio, or figure out a way to pull data from the radio's "codeplug"
